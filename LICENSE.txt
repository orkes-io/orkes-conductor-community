original shall be substituted, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted 
so as best to reasonably effect its original intent.
8.8	Waiver.  The failure by either Party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not 
constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.

of the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, oral or 
written, relating to the subject matter herein.  Any waiver, modification or amendment of any 
provision of this Agreement shall be effective only if in writing and signed by duly authorized 
representatives of the Parties.  No inconsistent or additional terms or conditions in any document 
provided by Licensee, including any purchase orders, purchase agreements, requests for
