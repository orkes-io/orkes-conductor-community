Thanks for your interest in contributing to Orkes. This guide helps to find the most efficient way to contribute, ask questions, and report issues.

## I want to contribute

We welcome Pull Requests and already had many outstanding community contributions! Creating and reviewing Pull Requests take considerable time. This section helps you to set up a smooth Pull Request experience.

We're currently accepting contributions for our [Community repository](https://github.com/orkes-io/orkes-conductor-community)
Please create pull requests for your contributions against Orkes Conductor community repo only.

Also, please consider that not every feature is a good fit for Orkes. A few things to consider for your contributions are:

* Is it increasing complexity for the user, or might it be confusing?
* Does it, in any way, break backward compatibility (this is seldom acceptable)
* Does it require new dependencies (this is rarely acceptable for core modules)
* Should the feature be opt-in or enabled by default. For integration with a new Queuing recipe or persistence module, a separate module which can be optionally enabled is the right choice.
* Should the feature be implemented in the main Orkes-Conductor repository, or would it be better to set up a separate repository? Especially for integration with other systems, a separate repository is often the right choice because the life-cycle of it will be different.
Of course, for more minor bug fixes and improvements, the process can be more light-weight.

We'll try to be responsive to Pull Requests. Do keep in mind that because of the inherently distributed nature of open source projects, responses to a PR might take some time because of time zones, weekends, and other things we may be working on.

##I want to report an issue
-----

If you found a bug, it is much appreciated if you create an issue. Please include clear instructions on how to reproduce the issue, or even better, include a test case on a branch. Make sure to come up with a descriptive title for the issue because this helps while organizing issues.
Please choose the right label against it. 

## I have a great idea for a new feature
Many features in Orkes have come from ideas from the community. If you think something is missing or certain use cases could be supported better, let us know! You can do so by opening a discussion on the discussion forum. Provide as much relevant context to why and when the feature would be helpful. Providing context is especially important for "Support XYZ" issues since we might not be familiar with what "XYZ" is and why it's useful. If you have an idea of how to implement the feature, include that as well.
Once we have decided on a direction, it's time to summarize the idea by creating a new issue.

Please note that any features will be added or worked on Orkes discretion.
