# Orkes Conductor
Orkes Conductor is a fully compatible version of Netflix Conductor with **Orkes certified stack**.
#### What is the community edition - OR how is it different from Netflix Conductor?
At Orkes we continue to maintain the Netflix Conductor, and while running Conductor at scale across multiple clouds (including on-prem) we have put together a stack that we leverage for our own cloud offering that is easy to maintain and operate.

As a way to contribute back to community, we are open sourcing the core stack we run our cloud offering to the community that makes it easy to run Netflix Conductor. This is a "certified" build of Netflix Conductor that is officially supported by Orkes.

## Stack
1. **Redis** is the primary store for running workflows.
2. **Postgres** for storing completed workflows and indexing enabling full text search.
3. **[Orkes-Queues](https://github.com/orkes-io/orkes-queues)** - Redis-based queues that improve upon dyno-queues and providers higher performance and are built from the ground up to support Redis standalone and cluster mode
### Dependency Versions

| Dependency                              | Supported Version |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Redis (Standalone, Cluster or Sentinel) | 6.2+              |
| Postgres                                | 14+               |

## Getting Started
### Docker
Docker is the easiest way to run Conductor.  Each release is published as `orkesio/orkes-conductor-community` docker images.

#### Fully self-contained standalone server with all the dependencies
Container images are useful for local development and testing.  
>**Note**: Self-contained docker image shouldn't be used in the production environment.

#### Simple self-contained script to launch the docker image
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orkes-io/orkes-conductor-community/main/scripts/run_local.sh | sh
```
#### Using `docker run` manually (Provides more control)
```shell

# Create volumes for persistent stores
# Used to create a persistent volume that will preserve the 
docker volume create postgres
docker volume create redis

docker run --init -p 8080:8080 -p 1234:5000 --mount source=redis,target=/redis \
--mount source=postgres,target=/pgdata orkesio/orkes-conductor-community-standalone:latest
```
Navigate to http://localhost:1234 once the container starts to launch UI.

#### Server + UI Docker
```shell
docker pull orkesio/orkes-conductor-community:latest
```
>**Note**: To use a specific version of Conductor, replace `latest` with the release version.
> e.g. 
> 
> ```docker pull orkesio/orkes-conductor-community:latest```

### Published Artifacts

The docker files are published at the following:
#### Server build suitable for the production deployment 
https://hub.docker.com/r/orkesio/orkes-conductor-community

#### Local build useful for local build and development
https://hub.docker.com/r/orkesio/orkes-conductor-community-standalone

#### Production Configuration Recommendations
The container and server jar published come with sensible defaults that work for most use cases.
